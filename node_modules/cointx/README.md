Crypto currency transactions. Mostly extracted from bitcoinjs-lib. 

Why don't I just use bitcoinjs-lib?

bitcoinjs-lib is probably the best Bitcoin JavaScript library. I have two problems with it 1) it's heavy on dependencies (fortunately, this can be reconciled) 2) its design is antithetical with the Node.js ethos (UNIX ethos) of small modules that do one thing well. Unfortunately, this can't be reconciled in the short-term. However, it's still an excellent library that shouldn't be overlooked.


Usage
-----

This package serves as an experimental replacement for https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/btc-script and https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/btc-transaction. Will be moved to github/cryptocoin. Usage documentation will be updated as it evolves.
